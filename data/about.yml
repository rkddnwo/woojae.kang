  text1: "Interaction designer based on product design and physics."
  text2: "<p>I am an interaction designer based on product design, particularly drawn to physical 
interactions, such as those experienced during physical activities. I want to provide a 
vivid and natural user experience while using the tangible product. For that I’m highly 
enthusiastic about exploring daily interactions like pushing buttons, lift boxes, etc. 
Additionally, I often adjust the responsiveness and sensitivity of electronic devices, 
express speed through color, and provide auditory feedback. By utilizing synesthetic 
expressions, I hope to share users with new and immersive experiences.<br><br>
My work involves exploring user-centered design thinking and conducting user research, 
based on experience during physics major and knowledge in electronics, various technologies, physics, and engineering.<br><br>
In the current era where virtual and physical realities intertwine, such as with XR, 
specialized products designed to specific situations are emerging beyond just smartphones. Physical interaction experiences are being realized through a variety of devices 
like Google Glass and smartwatches. I would like to share and communicate the experiences I enjoy through tangible interaction products which are specialized in certain contexts</p>"
