  title: "ROLLE"
  des: "After learning about the sculptural genre of Tensegrity, I thought it was one of the best 
ways to show the characteristics of strings. As dynamics was my favorite subject while 
majoring in physics, I wanted to maximize its potential. By leveraging the characteristics 
of strings, which can exhibit both flexibility and rigidity depending on tension, and their 
continuous length property, I designed an adjustable-height stand, ROLLE.<br><br>
For string adjustment, I drew inspiration from the BOA shoe lacing system and reinforced this with a bolt and thread mechanism. To keep the structure as simple as possible, I used three sticks with a central holding structure.<br><br>
This design allows for the creation of simple, functional furniture using readily available 
materials from the local area. By applying this concept, it is possible to create stools, 
tables, and other furniture with continuously adjustable height through a unique experience with ROLLE
