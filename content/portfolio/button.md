  text: "To understand the kind of feedback needed, I brought mock-ups to the climbing gym and conducted various tests with climbers. Initially, we focused on 
how the large button’s shape could be utilized in climbing, concentrating on the tactile sensation of pressing the button. Later, our focus shifted to the 
responsiveness when gripping, the mechanism for measuring force, and how to show feedback. To achieve this, I focused on minimizing data noise and 
determining the optimal placement of LEDs so they wouldn’t obstruct the climber’s view while holding the grip."

  des: "Sport climbing is a young sport, officially included in the Olympics starting with the 
Tokyo 2020 Games, and continuously evolving. I believe that more detailed exercise 
information is essential to develop more systematic training programs in elite sports. 
Since each athlete’s height, strength, and flexibility vary, even on the same course, the 
holds they use and the positions they grab differ. Therefore, systematically recording is 
crucial. Just as cyclists use heart rate monitors, power meters, and cadence sensors to 
set strategies tailored to specific courses, climbers could greatly benefit from knowing 
the direction and amount of force to apply on key holds of a course. BUTTON GAME 
can provide this information which would help in formulating more structured strategies 
on different courses. Additionally, based on their body type and climbing style, climbers 
could get recommendations on better holds and optimal directions of force by BUTTON
