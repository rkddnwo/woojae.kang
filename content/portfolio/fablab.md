  des: "FABLAB BCN needed a portable toolbox for children’s education that could be easily 
transported by car. The studio mainly used plywood due to its availability and ease of 
use by cnc. Therefore, we decided to create a versatile toolbox made from lightweight 
and sturdy plywood, ensuring it was safe for children and usable in various situations.<br><br>
The design focused on child safety by incorporating rounded corners. To enhance the 
production efficiency of these rounded corners, I used vacuum forming, allowing to 
produce the boxes from a single mold. Additionally, I repurposed the pin holes used for 
securing the vacuum-formed shapes into sliding slits, increasing both production efficiency and versatility.<br><br>
Inspired by pegboards, the toolbox’s identity centers around the box and slit holes. The 
hole sizes were matched to standard wood nail sizes, simplifying the sourcing of fastening materials. Overall, POPUPLAB is both functional and easy to produce, making it an 
ideal solution for versatile educational settings
