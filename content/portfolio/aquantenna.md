  des: "AQUANTENNA is a water quality sensor designed for swimming pools. Paired with The 
Wave Talk’s advanced water quality detection sensor, it ensures clean water quality with 
minimal maintenance fees.<br><br>
To measure water quality, a chamber to hold water and a reflector for the laser are 
required. Initially, including an internal chamber and reflector resulted in a bulky design 
that lacked a sleek appearance. Considering AQUANTENNA would be attached to 
the pool wall, we decided to use the pool wall as the reflector, allowing the laser to be 
directed straight at it. This innovation eliminated the need for an internal chamber and 
reflector, resulting in a much cleaner and more streamlined design. The overall shape, 
reminiscent of a water droplet, symbolizes pure and clean water.<br><br>
The upper section of the Aquantenna houses an antenna that connects to the home’s 
Wi-Fi, providing users with real-time updates on the pool’s water quality. 
Through a mobile app, users can monitor their pool’s water quality from anywhere
