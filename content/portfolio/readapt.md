  title: "RE-ADAPT"
  des: "After COVID-19, the importance of indoor ventilation and air cleanliness in public facilities has been highlighted. This will also become a crucial factor in the interiors of shared 
autonomous vehicles in the future. Vehicle interiors face multiple air pollution issues, 
including seat dust, bacteria, and harmful substances from interior materials.** To combat this, RE-ADAPT prioritize seat and air cleanliness, along with frequent ventilation.<br><br>
Airplane ventilation systems maintain fresh air by introducing fresh air from above and 
expelling exhaled air and dust through the floor. This one-way airflow creates an air 
curtain effect, reducing the risk of indoor infection transmission compared to other enclosed spaces. By applying this airplane ventilation system to car interiors, RE-ADAPT 
created an airflow system that moves from top to bottom, sending dust and particles 
to the floor. This not only cleans the air but also allows for the automatic cleaning of 
vehicle seats. RE-ADAPT propose this efficient and low-infection risk cleaning system 
for vehicle interiors.
