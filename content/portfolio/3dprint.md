  title: "SINGLE PATH 3D PRINT"
  des: "SING PATH 3D PRINT is an ongoing project aimed at creating unique lampshades using 
a 3D printer. This project presented two main challenges: designing a unique 3D print 
path and fine-tuning the appropriate temperature, material amount, and speed for 
printing.<br><br>
I believe that creating a custom 3D printing path can be considered a modern craft, as 
it requires precise control over speed, filament amount, and temperature, similar to how 
baking fine ceramics involves finding the right temperature, amount of porcelain glaze, 
and other factors.<br><br>
To create the custom G-code I desired, I used Grasshopper in Rhino 3D. I researched 
how to apply my desired pattern shapes to specific forms within Grasshopper. Through 
extensive testing, I identified the optimal temperature, speed, and material amount 
to consistently produce high-quality results. It was crucial to use a single 3D printer throughout the process because different printers and materials demand varying 
speeds, temperatures, and material amounts
