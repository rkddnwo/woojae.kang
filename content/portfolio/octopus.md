  des: "This project aimed to utilize engineering knowledge to create organic movements in a 
desired context. Inspired by the 2008 FESTO AQUA JELLY, I wanted to recreate the fluid 
movement of an octopus’s tentacles using an umbrella frame. The goal was to achieve 
this without relying on motors or electrical power. A similar reference is the 2017 SONY 
TOIO robotic cube papercraft. Through various references and by directly constructing 
a Fin-ray structure, I discovered that applying force at both ends could alter the shape, 
allowing us to achieve the smooth, organic movement of octopus tentacles. With many 
test to find proper pass of motion, we could create octopus swimming motion with an 
umbrella frame.<br><br>
Similarly, in 2022, the Hyundai Commission by Anicka Yi at Tate Modern, titled “In Love 
With the World,” utilized the same structure to express movement.
