  text: "Depend on exercise tempo, target muscle grows up in different type.**<br><br><br><br>
  The S-dumbbell changes color based on the speed of movement. The color of the dumbbell remains constant during the same tempo. Users will naturally exercise at a consistent speed if they keep the color steady during workout. Also they can notice whether they are maintaining a constant speed through a sound alarm."

  text: "To obtain accurate exercise tempo data, I collected and 
analyzed the movement of professional sports trainers and 
used the average to set the exercise tempo.<br><br>
Since electronic sensor always has noise, it is important to 
find way to smoothing raw data.<br><br> 
To catch noise from raw data and make bound of graph, I 
used two different smoothing. This algorithm will apply to 
raw data on dumbbell to prevent noise error."

  des: "Many people have come to understand the importance of proper exercise form and targeting the right muscles, but many still don’t know the importance of exercise tempo.<br><br>
According to research “Muscle Fiber Type Transitions with Exercise Training: Shifting 
Perspectives” by Plotki**, ratio of muscle twitch types developed can vary depending on 
the speed and method of training, even with the same exercise. Therefore, it is crucial to 
maintain a consistent exercise tempo depending on the user’s goal. However, many people focus only on correct form and overlook the importance of maintaining a consistent 
rhythm. To address this, S-dumbbell focuses on providing feedback on the user’s exercise tempo through visual and auditory stimuli, to which people are highly responsive.
